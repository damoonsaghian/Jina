Jina is a programming language with sane memory management, actors, and a coherent type system and syntax

Mahsa Jina Amini was a 22 years old girl, murdered by the evil Islamic regime in Iran
at her funeral, these words were written on a stone above her grave:
	beloved Jina, you will not die, your name will become a code

Jina has sane memory management, ie there is no garbage collector
	"https://www.toptal.com/software/eliminating-garbage-collector"
to achieve that, Jina introduces three special markers for types:
, unique type: T
, immutable shared type: T$
, immutable borrow type: T&
, mutable borrow type: T!

when a variable with unique type is aliased by another variable of the same unique type:
, if it's a static variable (ie a module definition), the alias is a reference to the original
	but when either variable is mutated, it will own a copy of the value (which will not be static anymore)
, otherwise, if the original variable is not used in the following block,
	its stack part will be copied, and its heap part will be moved into the alias
, otherwise, the alias will own a copy of the original

borrow types have a scope tag, which can be written after "&/!" marker
scope tags are inferred in most cases, and only required to be explicitly given, in certain situation
scope tags will be inherited by further borrowers
function arguments with borrow type have generic scope tags: a0, a1, a2 ...
for functions with multiple borrow arguments, that also return a borrow type,
	and the scope tag of returned type is inherited from any argument other than the first one (index 0),
	in the return type, it must be indicated that which argument will the tag be inherited from
	A&, B& -> C&1
the borrows created inside a function have scope tag "n+1", where "n" is the scope tag of the parent function
the scope tag in static functions (that have no parents) is zero
only borrows with matched scope tags can be assigned to each other (checked at compile'time)
this simple rule automatically guarantees correct lifetimes, cause it means:
, we can't assign a locally created (or moved) value, to a mutable borrow variable captured in a closure
, we can't return a borrow from a function, unless it's originally borrowed from one of the function's arguments

mutation of unique types, can only be seen by one variable
mutable borrow types allow shared mutation

dealing with allocated memory, at the end of functions:
, for unique types, if they are not moved out of the function, their heap memory will be deallocated
, for shared types, the reference count will be decreased by one, and when it reaches zero,
	their heap memory will be deallocated
, for borrow types, since they don't own the value, nothing happens

aliasing rules in variable definitions (and also assignments, in case of mutable ones, ie T and T!)
when a variable of type "T" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", static'borrow/move/copy
, a variable of type "T$", static'borrow/move/copy
, a variable of type "T&", borrow
, a variable of type "T!", borrow
when a variable of type "T$" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", copy
, a variable of type "T$", increase reference count
, a variable of type "T&", borrow
, a variable of type "T!", it's compile time error
when a variable of type "T&" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", copy
, a variable of type "T$", copy
, a variable of type "T&", borrow
, a variable of type "T!", it's compile time error
when a variable of type "T!" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", copy
, a variable of type "T$", copy
, a variable of type "T&", borrow
, a variable of type "T!", borrow

in Jina, type definitions containing borrow types, must have a borrow marker itself:
	T& := A, B$, C&, D!
this is necessary for their scope tags to be statically determined
in other words, borrows can't be wrapped, they always leak out
so plain types (without borrow markers) can only contain unique and shared types:
	T := A, $B
of course, it can be aliased by variables with types that have markers:
	v :T$
		v.0 :A$
		v.1 :B$
	v :T&
		v.0 :A&
		v.1 :B&
	v :T!
		v.0 :A!
		v.1 :B&

in Jina, functions are closures, ie they can capture their environment
function types have an implicit generic parameter for the captured variables
so in fact we have two kinds of functions in Jina:
, own closures: when the generic parameter does not have a borrow marker
	A -> B
, borrow closures: when the generic parameter has borrow marker
	A => B

sharing mutable data in concurrent parts of a program is problematic
a data race happens when these three behaviors occur:
, two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
, at least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
, there's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
to deal with it, programming languages choose different approaches:
, some implement complicated and error prone lock mechanisms
, some abandon concurrency, and make single threaded programs
, functional programming languages avoid mutability as much as possible
	and when mutability is necessary, they use monads or algebraic effects to control shared mutability
	avoiding mutability, and the need for aggressive garbage collection, is not good for performance

Jina uses actors for asynchronous programming, and controls aliasing (sharing) and mutability using type markers,
	ie the same approach used to deal with memory management
messages sent to actors are own closures, and can't capture borrows
	their captured variables have either unique or shared (immutable) type
thus messages can safely be called concurrently, since they can't change their captured environment

actors are opaque types, ie their internal components are not accessible,
	and are referred to by an ID, instead of a memory address
actors (and their messages) can only be destroyed explicitly
reference counting combined with interior mutability can create reference cycles
	"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html"
	in Jina interior mutability is only possible using actors
	since actors are not reference counted, there is no reference cycles in Jina

types show us what we can do with the data, ie which operations are valid
subtyping is problematic:
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)"
"https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/26/variance.html"
i feel that this problem was the motivation behind dynamic typing (another bad design)
to avoid this problem, some languages (eg Rust) have two kinds of types:
, concrete types can be instantiated, but cannot have subtypes
, abstract types (also called traits or interfaces) cannot be instantiated, but can have subtypes
Rust has trait objects (dynamic interfaces) with the same problem regarding variance
	https://users.rust-lang.org/t/vector-covariant-in-its-element-type/80582
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55200843/what-does-it-mean-that-box-is-covariant-if-boxdyn-b-is-not-a-subtype-of-boxdy
in Jina we have traits, but there is no trait objects

instead, in Jina we have convertible types
it's like in mathematics where we can easily do arithmetic across integer, rational, real and complex numbers
when a type is convertible to another type, it defines a specially named method,
	that converts its value to the target type
then when an expression is used in a place that its type does not match,
	the corresponding type'converting method is automatically added in the code
	and if the method actually exists, the code compiles successfully
the idea is to only do this for types that can be converted with negligible run'time overhead

Jina compiles to C3, and thus can easily use existing C libraries

Jina is installed by default in SPM Linux
in other Unix'like systems:
, first install "spm", by following the instructions mentioned in SPM Linux project
, then run this:
	spm install $gnunet_namespace jina
