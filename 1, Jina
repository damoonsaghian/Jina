Jina is a programming language with sane memory management, actors, and a coherent type system and syntax

Mahsa Jina Amini was a 22 years old girl, murdered by the evil Islamic regime in Iran
at her funeral, these words were written on a stone above her grave:
	beloved Jina, you will not die, your name will become a code

Jina has sane memory management, ie there is no garbage collector
	"https://www.toptal.com/software/eliminating-garbage-collector"
to achieve that, Jina introduces three special markers for types:
, unique type: T
, immutable shared type: T$
, immutable borrow type: T&
, mutable borrow type: T!

when a variable with unique type is aliased by another variable of the same unique type:
, if the original variable is not used in the following block (directly or through its borrowers),
	it's a move (heap part will not be copied)
, otherwise, it's a deep copy

variables with borrow types will be tagged by their owner
borrow tags will be inherited by further borrowers
function arguments with borrow type are tagged with integers, starting from zero
for functions with multiple borrow arguments, that also return a borrow type,
	and the scope tag of returned type is inherited from any borrow argument other than the first one (index 0),
	in the return type, it must be indicated that which borrow argument will the tag be inherited from
	A, B&, C& -> C&2
the borrow tag of variables captured in a closure, will be prefixed with "PARENT_"
only borrows with matched tags can be assigned to each other (checked at compile'time)
this simple rule automatically guarantees correct lifetimes, cause it means:
, we can't assign a locally created (or moved) value, to a mutable borrow variable captured in a closure
, we can't return a borrow from a function, unless it's originally borrowed from one of the function's arguments

mutation of unique types, can only be seen by one variable
mutable borrow types allow shared mutation

dealing with allocated memory, at the end of functions:
, for unique types, if they are not moved out of the function, their heap memory will be deallocated
, for shared types, the reference count will be decreased by one, and when it reaches zero,
	their heap memory will be deallocated
, for borrow types, since they don't own the value, nothing happens

aliasing rules in variable definitions (and also assignments, in case of mutable ones, ie T and T!)
when a variable of type "T" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", move/copy
, a variable of type "T$", move/copy
, a variable of type "T&", shallow copy
, a variable of type "T!", shallow copy
when a variable of type "T$" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", copy
, a variable of type "T$", shallow copy, increase reference count
, a variable of type "T&", shallow copy
, a variable of type "T!", it's compile time error
when a variable of type "T&" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", copy
, a variable of type "T$", copy
, a variable of type "T&", shallow copy
, a variable of type "T!", it's compile time error
when a variable of type "T!" is put into:
, a variable of type "T", copy
, a variable of type "T$", copy
, a variable of type "T&", shallow copy
, a variable of type "T!", shallow copy

in Jina, type definitions containing borrow types, must have a borrow marker themselves:
	T& := A, B$, C&, D!
this is necessary for their scope tags to be statically determined
in other words, borrows can't be wrapped, they always leak out
so plain types (without borrow markers) can only contain unique and shared types:
	T := A, B$
of course, it can be aliased by variables with types that have markers:
	v :T$
		v.0 :A$
		v.1 :B$
	v :T&
		v.0 :A&
		v.1 :B&
	v :T!
		v.0 :A!
		v.1 :B&

in Jina, functions are closures, ie they can capture their environment
each function has its own distinct type that includes the type of the captured variables
but we usually do not work with function types directly
what we care about is the interface that a particular function implements
	f[t::(A,B->C)] :t& = { a :A, b :B -> C | ... }
	f[t::(A,B->C)] :t = { a :A, b :B -> C || ... }
a borrow closure (with type "t&") can have borrowed captured variables; an own closure (with type "t") can't

sharing mutable data in concurrent parts of a program is problematic
a data race happens when these three behaviors occur:
, two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
, at least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
, there's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
to deal with it, programming languages choose different approaches:
, some implement complicated and error prone lock mechanisms
, some abandon concurrency, and make single threaded programs
, functional programming languages avoid mutability as much as possible
	and when mutability is necessary, they use monads or algebraic effects to control shared mutability
	avoiding mutability, and the need for aggressive garbage collection, is not good for performance

Jina uses actors for asynchronous programming, and controls aliasing (sharing) and mutability using type markers,
	ie the same approach used to deal with memory management
messages sent to actors are own closures, and can't capture borrows
	their captured variables have either unique or shared (immutable) type
thus messages can safely be called concurrently, since they can't change their captured environment

actors are opaque types, ie their internal components are not accessible,
	and are referred to by an ID, instead of a memory address
actors (and their messages) can only be destroyed explicitly
reference counting combined with interior mutability can create reference cycles
	"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html"
	in Jina interior mutability is only possible using actors
	and since actors are not reference counted, there is no reference cycles in Jina

types show us what we can do with the data, ie which operations are valid
subtyping is problematic:
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)"
"https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/26/variance.html"
i feel that this problem was the motivation behind dynamic typing (another bad design)
to avoid this problem, some languages (eg Rust) have two kinds of types:
, concrete types can be instantiated, but cannot have subtypes
, abstract types (also called traits or interfaces) cannot be instantiated, but can have subtypes
Rust has trait objects (dynamic interfaces) with the same problem regarding variance
	https://users.rust-lang.org/t/vector-covariant-in-its-element-type/80582
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55200843/what-does-it-mean-that-box-is-covariant-if-boxdyn-b-is-not-a-subtype-of-boxdy
in Jina we have interfaces, but there is no dynamic interfaces

instead, in Jina we have convertible types
it's like in mathematics where we can easily do arithmetic across integer, rational, real and complex numbers
when type "A" is convertible to type "B", it implements a special method named "into'B"
then when an expression of type "A" is used in a place that wants type "B",
	the compiler automatically inserts ".to'B"
the idea is to only do this for types that can be converted with negligible run'time overhead

Jina compiles to C++, and thus can easily use existing C/C++ libraries
C++ (unlike Rust) allows us to have packages that are compiled independently as dynamic libraries,
	then imported and used in other packages
C++ may look ugly on the outside, but to quote its creator:
	"within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out"
	and i think that is "Jina"
C was the first attempt to make programming easier by introducing types and functions
after C, there was generally two approaches in creating more advanced programming languages
, garbage collection (the wrong approach): Java, C# ...
, C++: keep pointers for systems programming, but otherwise use references, move semantic, and RAII

Jina can be build and installed using "upm" (Uni's package manager)
