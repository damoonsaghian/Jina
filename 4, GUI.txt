implementing a complete GUI toolkit is a lot of work
existing ones (like GTK) are single threaded
thus we can't access GTK widgets (and data structures containing them), from inside actors
solution:
"https://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib/source/fn.idle_add.html"
"https://docs.rs/fragile/1.0.0/fragile/struct.Fragile.html"
"https://docs.rs/send_wrapper/0.4.0/send_wrapper/"
we deal with Gobjects by wrapping them in a Gsend
Gsend embeds a Fragile which will be created in the GTK main thread (using "idle_add"),
  and then received (and put inside the Gsend) using a channel
Gsend.new gets a closure (instead of a Gobject value),
  the closure's return type is the type of the specific Gobject
